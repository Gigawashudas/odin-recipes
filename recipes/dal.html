    <h1>Dal</h1>
    <img src="/Images/dal.webp" alt="RecipeImage">
    <p>In Hindi language, dal or dahl is the generic term for lentils as well as the recipes made from lentils. Dal or lentils are a staple in Indian cuisine and make for an excellent plant-based source of protein.Dal Fry is a dish that is made in various ways in many Indian homes with tuvar dal or pigeon pea lentils.If you are new to Indian cuisine, you may think that the words dal fry indicate that some ingredients are being fried or the lentils are fried. Let me assure you that we dont fry anything in a dal fry.Here is how we make it. First, the lentils are cooked until soft and mushy. Note that we do not cook al dente lentils.The soft-cooked lentils or dal is then mixed with a sautéed mixture of spices, onions, tomatoes and herbs. Then simmered for a few minutes.In the Indian terminology, we often use the word fry for sautéed and hence the term dal fry. Though technically speaking nothing is deep fried or shallow fried.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Veggies:</strong> You will need an onion and tomato, both finely chopped for this dal fry recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Green Chilies:</strong> Not as hot as jalapeños but just the right level of spice for the dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Curry Leaves:</strong> The subtle flavor of curry leaves are essential in this recipe. But if you don’t have it, then might well as skip it – though some flavor profile will be amiss.</li>
        <li><strong>Asafoetida Powder (hing):</strong> If using a strong asafoetida, then just one pinch is enough. I would definitely recommend adding a small amount at a time and seasoning to taste. And if you do not have asafoetida, then simply skip it.</li>
        <li><strong>Coriander leaves (cilantro):</strong> This simple herb brings a much needed hint of freshness to the dal fry.</li>
        <li><strong>Kasuri Methi (dry fenugreek leaves):</strong> Brings restaurant style flavors to the dal and gives a nutty aroma. Skip if you do not have it.</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Seasonings:</strong> You will also need several Indian pantry staples, including ginger, black mustard seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, Garam Masala powder, oil, lemon juice, and salt.</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse your lentils in water for 3 to 4 times. I would recommend using ½ cup tuvar dal (arhar dal or pigeon pea lentils) or ¼ cup each of tuvar dal and masoor dal (pink or orange lentils).</li>
        <li>After rinsing, pour the lentils into a 2-liter pressure cooker and toss in a pinch of turmeric powder and 1.5 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook the lentils for 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat, or until they are thoroughly cooked and completely soft. Once lentils are cooked, mash them with a spoon or wired whisk, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil, ghee or unsalted butter in a pan or skillet. Once hot, add ½ or ¾ teaspoon of black mustard seeds.</li>
        <li>When you hear the mustard seeds start crackling, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and fry them with the mustard seeds for several seconds or until they change color. You should hear the same crackle for the cumin seeds!</li>
        <li>With the mustard and cumin seeds still in the pan, add ⅓ cup of chopped onions.</li>
        <li>Sauté the seeds and onion mixture until the onions become translucent or lightly browned.</li>
        <li>When the onions have lightly browned, add in 1 to 1.5 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste and stir to combine. Sauté the mixture for a few seconds or until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic goes away on a low heat.</li>
        <li>Finally, add in 10 to 12 curry leaves, 2 to 3 dry red chilies, and 1 to 2 green chilies. Stir to combine with the ginger-garlic paste mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix well on a low heat, stirring to combine the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add all the spice powders and mix again!
            <ul>
                <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne or smoked paprika (For a light smoky flavor)</li>
                <li>1 to 2 pinches of asafoetida, or hing (Skip if you do not have it.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After mixing thoroughly, add about ⅓ to ½ cup of finely chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Stir together one more time and continue to sauté until the tomatoes become soft and pulpy.</li>
        <li>Add your mashed lentils to sautéed onion-tomato masala mixture in the pan or skillet.</li>
        <li>Combine and mix everything evenly with the rest of the masala mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 to 1.5 cups of water. You can adjust the consistency of dal fry by adding more or less water as per your taste preferences.</li>
        <li>Mix and stir thoroughly to get a smooth and even consistency.</li>
        <li>Season with salt as per taste. Stir and mix again.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes on low to medium heat. Stir occasionally, so that the lentils do not stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of crushed kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and sprinkle ¼ to ½ teaspoon of garam masala powder.</li>
        <li>Stir and simmer for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Switch off the heat and add 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves. You can also add ½ to 1 teaspoon lemon juice at this step for a little added freshness and tang.</li>
        <li>Stir just one last time.</li>
    </ol>
